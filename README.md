## project description:

This project is a team work done while the authors were students at Holberton School to cover all the fundamentals concepts of the higher level programming track.   
It covers the following fields:
- A website (call front-end) that shows the final product to everybody
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

## description of the command interpreter:
####     how to start it
The command interpreter starts when running `./console.py`.
It can work both in interactive and non interactive mode (see examples).
The following commands have been implemented:

####     how to use it
| Command  | Syntax                        |Definition                                    |

| `quit`   |`quit`                         |or `EOF` (end of file) to terminate session.   | 
| `create` |`create` `<class name>`                    |creates an object |
|`show`    |`show` `<class name>`                      |prints the string representation of an object|
| `destroy`|`destroy` `<class name>` `<id>`      |deletes an object|
|`all`     |`all` `<class name>`              |shows all representations of objects|
|`update`  |`update` `<class name>` `<id>` `<attr key>` `<attr val>`||
